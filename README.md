# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game using JavaFX. Play with a friend or against the computer with different levels
This project is about tic tac toe game. It has different features such as playing with another friend (offline)
or playing against the computer.
The user can choose which level they want to play when playing against the computer (easy, medium or hard).
And the user can even choose which symbol they want to play with. X , O or even they can let the computer choose for them randomly.
This application has all the sound effects needed such as background music, button click sound, winning and losing sound effects.
The user can mute the background music from the settings window (they can access it using the settings button in the start window)
or they can just leave it on. They can also exit the whole game using the exit button in the settings window too.
Whatever mode the user is playing with, each new game the computer will declare whose turn it is randomly (X or O / Computer or User).
Easy level was made to make the computer choose any available square randomly.
Medium level was made to choose at the first moves only the corner squares (one square by a time, randomly)
only if any one of them was available. If they were not, then it will choose the center square.
If it was not available either, then, it will choose any other random square if it’s not occupied.
Hard level was made to do the same thing done with medium level.
Only one different thing is to check every single move if there is a winning state, if so,
then it will make the winning move. And if there was a winning state for the user,
the computer will prevent it. And if there were both probabilities, then, the computer will make the winning move.
It’s not undefeatable though because the computer is not always playing the first move which contributes in winning the game.
